## Setup Laravel
1.clone the project
2.copy the .env.example and change to .env
3.run the following command
php artisan key:generate
composer update
php artisan migrate

## API
To find the api,go to route folder and api.php. 
To access the api,user need the authorization token(which is '2S7rhsaq9X1cnfkMCPHX64YsWYyfe1he')

## View point 
if i get more time, I would have written the test to check the api, refactor the controller code, normalize the database and more about readme documentaion.
